This is a simple too I've started to learn more about express and to provide a simple tool I can throw up on heroku to track any crashes from my android apps.

There are lots of missing features so far. I'm open to patches, I'll be working on it over time.

Run locally

Install dependencies:

    npm install

Launch the app with [Foreman](http://blog.daviddollar.org/2011/05/06/introducing-foreman.html):
